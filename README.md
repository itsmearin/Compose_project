## Course Description

Get a comprehensive understanding of how Kotlin programming and its idioms facilitate writing efficient code in Compose. In this course, instructor Annyce Davis shows you how to identify the key similarities and differences between UI architecture in Android applications when using the traditional View system compared to the Compose system. Explore the essentials of using the Material Design system within Compose to create visually appealing user interfaces that align with your app's style and brand. Additionally, find out how to design Android applications with multiple screens and implement smooth navigation between them. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be prepared to develop Android applications that follow declarative programming best practices, including effective use of unit and integration testing.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
